                                <p>Ruby (also known as Ruby on Rails) is a major supplier of web apps. Ruby is popular due to
                                    its ease of learning (it's very straightforward) and power. Ruby knowledge is in high

                                <p>JavaScript (which, confusingly, is not at all related to Java) is another favorite programming
                                    language because it's so ubiquitous on the web--it's basically everywhere. JavaScript
                                    allows developers to add interactive elements to their website, and its presence is felt
                                    across the internet. At WordStream, we use a JavaScript library called JQuery to make
                                    our JavaScript work even easier.</p>

                                <p>Objective-C is the programming language behind iOS apps. Apple's new language Swift is rising
                                    in the ranks, but Objective-C is still the recommended starting point for those looking
                                    to craft Apple apps for iPhones and iPads. Next stop--the iOS App Store!

                                <p><acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> (which stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, if you care to know) is often used in conjunction
                                    with dynamic data-heavy websites and app development. It provides a ton of power and
                                    is the beating heart of monster sites like WordPress and Facebook. What's really cool
                                    about PHP is that it's an open-source language, so there are tons of free pre-built modules
                                    that you can grab and modify to get your ideal results. PHP is also on the easy end of
                                    the learning spectrum, simply requiring you to embed the code within HTML. PHP is a must-learn
                                    language for aspiring web developers.</p>
