            <p class="description">Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van
                Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes
                code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets
                or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might
                be used in languages such as C++ or Java. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small
                and large scales. Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple
                programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large
                and comprehensive standard library. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. CPython,
                the reference implementation of Python, is open source software and has a community-based development model,
                as do nearly all of its variant implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.</p>
