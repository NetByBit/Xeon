                <p class="description">Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido
                    van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes
                    code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets
                    or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might
                    be used in languages such as C++ or Java. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both
                    small and large scales. Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports
                    multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and
                    has a large and comprehensive standard library. Python interpreters are available for many operating
                    systems. CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software and has a community-based
                    development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit
                    Python Software Foundation.</p>
